        			<p><strong>November 9, 2011</strong>- At this point, the District 3 County Legislator race is too close to call. The Westchester County Board of Elections has impounded all voting machines and paper ballots until further notice. At this time, both Michael Smith and John Nonna are tied with 50% of the vote, Nonna pulling slightly ahead with a +60 vote advantage. However, this number does not account for seven (7) remaining districts still not accounted for and for the paper, absentee ballots which total over 200. After all the legislative elections, the Democratic stranglehold on our county government is still in tact, with this seat being the deciding one. Michael Smith hopes he can break that stranglehold with a victory. Stay tuned to this page as well as Michael's Facebook page,<a href="http://www.facebook.com/smithforlegislator">www.facebook.com/smithforlegislator</a>, for updates as they come in.</p>

        			<p><strong>November 7, 2011</strong>- Tomorrow is Election Day, the day we can take Westchester back from the tax and spend legislators on the Board. Join County Executive Astorino in supporting Michael Smith for District 3. The County Executive needs an ally on the Board to help push forth tax relief and reign in the out-of-control spending. Be sure to contact all of your family and friends and please, above all, VOTE!</p>
        			<p><strong>November 5, 2011</strong>- Michael Smith is running to represent the values of our community. As a father, coach, and community leader, he understands that we need a change on the Board of Legislators in order to represent these values. Our current legislator John Nonna is too liberal and out of the mainstream. One only has to look at his tax and spend record on the Board. But Mr. Nonna was also an attorney for the uber-radical political group ACORN (Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now), which was tied to the massive Obama voter registration fraud in more than 15 states. ACORN was eventually defunded by Congress in 2009. Mr. Nonna has also already donated $15,000 to President Barack Obama's re-election campaign (see link images below). It is time for a change in representation in District 3. That change is Michael Smith.</p>
