        			<h1>Vision</h1>
        			<p>I support County Executive Rob Astorino and his vision for Westchester. Like him, I believe Westchester needs to be governed by those who act in the best interests of our community instead of those who use the Legislature as a mere stepping stone for their own political advancement. As a citizen legislator, I am not looking to run for higher office, or even keep this position for many years. We need to stop the career politicians in the County Legislature so real reform can take place. </p>
        			<p>Furthermore, the safety of our family, friends and neighbors must be protected. Decisions for the future of the Tappan Zee Bridge and the Indian Point power plant must be made soon. Flooding on County parkways and in our local communities continues to be a problem too. It's time for the Westchester County Legislators to start making decisions and having their voices heard in Albany. Take, for example, the Tappan Zee Bridge. The truth is, the span has outlived its life expectancy. Instead of being reactive and waiting for a tragedy to occur, let's stop &quot;studying&quot; what we can do and just do it!</p>
