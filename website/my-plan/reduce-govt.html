        			<h1>Reduce the Size of County Government and Reduce Spending to Lower Taxes</h1>
        			<p>1) Taxes need to be lower and essential services must be provided on a cost-effective basis. There is no honor in having the highest taxes in the country. Again, Westchester County is #1 for having the highest property taxes in the entire United States of America. Are the services that we are receiving really that much better than everyone else throughout the country to warrant the cost? We desperately need to lower the tax burden on all of our residents and put an end to the runaway spending by the Board of Legislators.</p>
        			<p>So how can we finally provide real tax relief? See Point #2.<br>
    				</p>
        			<p>2. Promote business growth and development in Westchester: Westchester must be promoted as open for business. Legislators must be proactive in encouraging sustainable business growth within the county and not viewed as a hindrance to development. We will need more innovative thinking. As a chief financial officer chartered financial analyst and certified public accountant, when there is a problem, I cannot make a new law or tax to get around it. I have to solve the problem. It is time our legislators use common sense and not hinder business growth with excessive taxes and regulations. As the County Legislator for District 3, I am promoting a pro-growth agenda for business development in Westchester. By doing so, this can lead to an increase in the County's revenue base, thus lowering residential, commercial and school property taxes. This also has the potential to create jobs right here at home for Westchester residents and taxpayers.</p>
