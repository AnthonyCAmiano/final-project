        			<h1>Housing Settlement</h1>
        			<p>The affordable housing settlement is government run amok. We have worked too hard to have our rights taken away and the value of our homes destroyed by the government. We need to stop letting the federal government think they can go outside the boundaries of the original settlement. In what was supposed to be a $52 million dollar project for 750 affordable housing units, would grow to in excess of nearly $100 million if the federal regulators have their way. Local zoning laws were supposed to be respected too. The federal government wants the County to sue local municipalities who do not comply with this overriding of zoning laws. We do not need the federal government telling us what type of housing to build and where we should build it in our community.<br>
    				</p>
        			<p>I am a firm supporter of affordable housing, workforce housing and housing for seniors but what the federal government wants is to implement a integration housing plan. They even want the County to market these units to those outside of the County with your tax dollars! The fact is, Westchester County is the 4th most diverse county in all of New York State.<br>
    				</p>
        			<p>Our zoning is not discriminatory. I know I cannot afford a $10 million house. That is not discrimination; it's economics. The County Board needs to stand with County Executive Astorino and fight the federal government's overreaching as opposed to their current solution of government by lawsuit, which costs taxpayers unnecessary money and looks for judges to do the job of our elected officials.</p>
